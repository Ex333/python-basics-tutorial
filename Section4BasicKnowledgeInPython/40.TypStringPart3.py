# Here we learn how to convert a string into an integer
# and perform a simple mathematical operation on it.

# This variable looks like a number, but it is actually a string
somethingLikeNumber = "1000"

# Convert the string to an integer
new = int(somethingLikeNumber)

# Increase the number by 1
new += 1

# Print the result
print(new)
